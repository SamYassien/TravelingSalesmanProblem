# TravelingSalesmanProblem


This program reads in a graph as a weight matrix and solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using two solutions:

1) Brute Force (Trivial).

2) Dynamic Programming (Non-Trivial).


Running Instructions:

The program reads the graph from a file named "input.txt", you can edit this file with your own examples, as far as the format is maintained.
Example graphs can be found in ExampleInput.txt file.
The output will be written in a file named "output.txt".


You can find included a file called "Performance.txt" documenting the performance of the two solutions on the graphs in ExampleInputs.txt.
